    <p>Through testing it has been shown that the rehabilitation process is much faster when using Virtual Reality as a tool. Two groups were tested, one using
      Virtual Reality as a rehabilitation tool and the other group used traditional rehabilitation methods.

      <h2>Why VR?</h2>
      <p>What is VR?</p>
      <p>VR stands for Virtual Reality. Virtual reality allows you to experience something unique. Through a combination of hardware, software and sensory synchronicity, VR brings you closer to another reality.
        You get a feeling of truly being present in the given environment.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/global_revenues_graph.png" alt="VR hlobal revenue stats shown in $">
      <p>The VR software and hardware market size is expected to grow continuously. It is expected that global revenue from VR hardware and software will generate over $20 billion by 2020. This is a huge jump over just 4 years</p>
      <img src="assets/images/VR_headsets_sold_graph.png" alt="VR headset sales">
      <p>The general population is becoming more interested in VR technology, in 2017 alone over 12 million VR headsets were sold, it's expected to increase to 68 million by 2020.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/interest_in_VR_graph.png" alt="Interest in VR graph">
